%% EXERCISE 1

%% (a)
% Since the initial value problem is:
% 
% $$
% \left\{\begin{array}{l}
% y^{\prime}(t)=1-y^2, \quad t \in(0,20), \\
% y(0)=0.
% \end{array}\right.
% $$
%
% Thus, we can get that the forward Euler method is:
% 
% $$
% \left\{\begin{array}{l}
% u_0 = y_0, \\
% u_{n+1} = u_n + h_n f(t_n, u_n).
% \end{array}\right.
% $$

% 
% In the two loglog figures above, each figure show a straight line with 
% slope p and offset logC.
% 
% According to the calculation results, we can know that for the forward
% Euler method, the slope p = 1.136, so the convergence order of the
% forward Euler method is 1. Moreover, for the Heun's method, we calculated
% the slope p = 2.502, so the convergence order of the Heun's method is 2.
% 
% Therefore, the results of our actual calculation agree with the theory
% from lectures.

%% (d)
% 
% According to the figures we draw above, not every approximation reproduce
% the same asymptotic behaviour. Obviously, the value of y(20) is
% approximated well for both methods when N = 40, 80, 160, and the y(20) is
% approximated not well in the early stage for both methods when N = 21. 
% However, in the case of N = 19, the approximation is bad.
%
% 
% Yes, because when N = 19 (h = 20 / 19 > 1), the asymptotic behaviour
% cannot approximate y(20); but when N = 21 (h = 20 / 21 < 1), the
% asymptotic behaviour approximate y(20) relative well. So, the methods are
% stable when critical value of h = 1.
%
% 
% For the forward Euler method, the lack of stability for N = 19 is 
% reflected in the approximation shows fluctuation, and the fluctuation 
% increases as t -> 20. 
%
% For the Heun's method, the lack of stability for N = 19 is 
% reflected in the approximation cannot approximate y(20), and its value 
% reached 0.64 instead of 1 when t = 20.
